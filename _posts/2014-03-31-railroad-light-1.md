A few years ag I bought an old railroad signal light at a swap meet.  I though it would be fun to convert it into an RGB indicator or some kind of multi-color stop light for my kids to play with outside while riding their bikes.


I don't have the electronics done, but the results so far show some promise:

</video>


The original light was a little broken, but for $10, I can't complain.  Once I'm done, I might replace the circle of black plastic 
since it's cracked, but I might just be able to glue and screw it to get it to keep the right shape.
