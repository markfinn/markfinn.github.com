I haven't been able to print since I moved the printer out to my new workshop and it got cold.  Even when I was using the furnace, it was just to draft and I got ridiculous warping.

I'm going to build a heated enclosure soon, partly due to [Misumi](http://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/)'s recent discount offered on [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1x6qd3/update_150_worth_of_free_stuff_from_my_company/).  In the mean time, I learned that plastic garbage bags are enough, and I was actually able to get a [good print](http://www.mfinn.net/2014/03/31/railroad-light-1/#print).
